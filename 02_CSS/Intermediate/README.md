### CSS Architecture Principles
```css
/* Component-based CSS structure */
.card {
  /* Base component styles */
}

.card--featured {
  /* Variant modifier */
}

.card__header {
  /* Child element */
}

.card__title {
  /* Nested child element */
}
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use efficient selectors (avoid universal and complex selectors)
- Minimize reflows and repaints with transform/opacity
- Implement critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Use contain property for layout optimization

### Modern CSS Features
- CSS Grid for complex 2D layouts
- Flexbox for 1D layouts and alignment
- Custom properties for maintainable theming
- CSS logical properties for international layouts

### Responsive Design Strategy
- Mobile-first approach for better performance
- Progressive enhancement with feature queries
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Fluid typography with clamp() and viewport units

## üõ† Best Practices

### Code Organization
```css
/* 1. Custom properties */
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --spacing-unit: 1rem;
}

/* 2. Reset/normalize styles */
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* 3. Base element styles */
body {
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
}

/* 4. Layout utilities */
.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* 5. Components */
.button {
  /* Component styles */
}

/* 6. Page-specific styles */
.home-page .hero {
  /* Page-specific styles */
}
```

### Naming Conventions
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology
- Create consistent naming patterns
- Use semantic class names, not presentational
- Implement a design system approach

### Responsive Design
- Start with mobile-first approach
- Use relative units (rem, em, %) over fixed pixels
- Implement fluid typography and spacing
- Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools

### Performance
- Minimize CSS bundle size
- Use CSS containment for performance
- Optimize for critical rendering path
- Implement CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for large applications
