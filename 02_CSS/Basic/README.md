## üé® Color Theory for Developers

### Primary Color Systems:
- **Hex**: `#FF5733` (most common in web development)
- **RGB**: `rgb(255, 87, 51)` (red, green, blue values)
- **HSL**: `hsl(15, 100%, 60%)` (hue, saturation, lightness)
- **RGBA/HSLA**: Include alpha channel for transparency

### Typography Best Practices:
- **Font stacks**: Always provide fallbacks
- **Line height**: 1.4-1.6 for body text

### Performance Considerations:
- Minimize CSS file size and HTTP requests
- Use CSS minification in production
- Avoid deep selector nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Use efficient selectors (avoid universal selectors)

### Code Organization:
- Group related styles together
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Comment complex calculations or hacks
- Separate concerns (layout, typography, colors)

### Accessibility:
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Test with high contrast mode
- Consider users with color blindness
